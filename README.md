# Hi there! 👋

My name is Lennard and I am a software engineer with a passion for AI! 🚀

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... <br>
Finetuning LLMs to my own data <br>
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... <br>
about transformer models <br>

## My Projects 📚

| Computer Vision 👁️‍🗨️ | NLP 🗣️ |
|---|---|
| [Visual Emotion Detector](https://github.com/L-Heidrich/Visual_emotion_detection)  <br> A GCP hosted CNN trained to recognize a person's mood based on their facial expression. The model can be called via the Cloud Run API. | [NLP and Transformers](https://github.com/L-Heidrich/NLP_and_transformers)  <br> This repository is dedicated to studying NLP, specifically transformers. It contains a script for using BERT Attention as a search function. |
| [Landscape Classification](https://github.com/L-Heidrich/Pytorch-landscape-classification)  <br> A ResNet model trained to identify landscapes. The model is integrated into a simple website with a Django backend. |

## My Bachelor's Thesis: Adversarial Examples - Attacks, Defences, and Implementations 🎓

In my thesis, I have explored how deep neural networks can be fooled in the task of image classification. The repository contains scripts and examples demonstrating how to attack a model trained on MNIST, as well as my thesis which explains how adversarial examples work.
